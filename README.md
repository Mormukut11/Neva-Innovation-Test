# 1) Cropping Bacterial test Strips from Images

I have used python Imaging Library PILLOW to crop the Images from the given folder.

Assign the path to folder.

Define the crop function to crop the images.

You can change the size of cropped images according to your requirement.

# 2) Classification Problem

I have used R and RStudio to design multilayer neural network to identify the type of iris plant from iris dataset.

Using keras to design the model on top of tensorflow.

Load the data in RStudio.

Perform EDA on iris data.

Normalize the data.

Split the data into train and test dataset.

split the class attribute and perform the one hot encoding for test and train dataset.

Initialize the sequential model.

Add the layer to model.

Compile the model.

Fit the model and evalute the model.

Plot the accuracy and loss of the model.

Accuracy is around 95%

In every code file comments are mentioned for each new step.
